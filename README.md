Note: To use this app you need to set your's project folder permission so Your user can read/write and also needs to be applied to all sub folders/files.

Note: It can work for some users out-of-box, without setting this, but if it doesnt work then you need to set correct permissions.

Roadmap for 1.0 (If I have enough time...)
- Migration designer (very simple designer for migrations)
- Editing migrations which were created using Artison?
- Package manager support (http://packalyst.com)?
- Add Laravel IDE helper to root directory of project, and maybe cmd line support too?
